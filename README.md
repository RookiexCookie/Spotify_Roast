# Spotify Roast 🎧🔥

Welcome to **Spotify Roast** — a cheeky Next.js app that signs in with Spotify, inspects your top tracks and artists (or a playlist), and delivers brutally accurate Hinglish-style roasts about your music taste. Use it for friendly ribbing, savage banter, or convincing your friends that your music criticism is technically cultural analysis. 😈

---

## What it shows 💡

- A bold, animated UI with themes (Neon, Cyberpunk, Retro, Minimal) and 3D-tilt cards for each detected song/artist.
- A **playlist-level roast** summary + a **score (0–100)** that rates how replaceable your playlist makes you.
- Individual roasts for songs/artists generated by an AI prompt (Gemini + OpenRouter fallback).
- Fun UI flourishes: `CustomCursor.tsx`, `ParticleBackground.tsx`, animated skeletons, and a `Providers.tsx` wrapper for auth/state.

Files you’ll care about:

- `src/app/page.tsx` — main UI and roast flow
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` — Spotify sign-in and token handling
- `src/app/api/roast/route.ts` — AI roast generation (Gemini / OpenRouter)
- `src/components/CustomCursor.tsx` & `src/components/ParticleBackground.tsx` — visual goodies

## Quick Start 🚀

1. Install deps:

```bash
npm install
# or pnpm install
```

2. Add required env vars (create `.env.local`):

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key_or_leave_blank
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_if_no_gemini
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=some_long_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Run it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 and sign in with Spotify. Tap/click "Roast me" or paste a playlist URL to see the magic.

## How it works 🔧

1. You sign in with Spotify (via NextAuth). The server fetches your top tracks/artists (or accepts a playlist URL).
2. The app sends the items to `POST /api/roast`, where a strict AI prompt (see `src/app/api/roast/route.ts`) crafts:
   - A single playlist-level roast
   - A numeric score (0–100)
   - A roast for each item (1–2 sentences, Hinglish-ish, savage)
3. The frontend displays the results with animated cards, an overall score, and theme-driven UI.

> The roast prompt intentionally aims to embarrass the listener (it’s mean by design — only use with consent!).

## Features & UX notes ✨

- Themes: switch between visual vibes (see `themes` in `page.tsx`).
- Card interaction: hover for desktop (3D tilt), tap to reveal on mobile.
- Skeletons and spinners for good UX while the AI thinks.
- Fallbacks: if Gemini is rate-limited, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` will be used.

---

## Development tips 🧪

- The AI expects a very strict JSON output format; look at `src/app/api/roast/route.ts` if you want to tune the prompt.
- You can test with fake data quickly by editing `page.tsx`'s `roastData` state in dev.
- Need to tweak auth scopes? Check `authorization.params.scope` in the NextAuth provider.
